## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use ```fetch()``` function to load dynamically json data and that I need to use ```.json()``` for getting the data to use.
I also came to know how to use ```async``` and  ```await```
