## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

It's my first project using React, and I learned how to configure the structure for a react project and to manage state by using `useState()` and `useEffect()`.
Also, I learned how to make custom radio button.

### Continued development

I want to get accustomed to use react library and I have a plan to use `styled-component` and `Next.js`.
